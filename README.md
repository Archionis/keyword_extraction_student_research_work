Keyword Extraction Research Work in AM-CP SPBU
The research consists of comparing the KeyBERT, RAKE, TopicRank, TextRank, and YAKE models on the INSPEC and SemEval2010 datasets.
in keyphrase_extraction_benchmark_INSPEC.ipynb I compared models with F1-score on INSPEC dataset with minimum text preprocessing
in keyphrase_extraction_benchmark_SemEval2010.ipynb with the same way, but got a bad results(SemEval2010's taksta contained characters that I didn't process)
